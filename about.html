                <p>Hi...I am <i>Debjani Mondal,</i> a software engineer by profession and singer, songwriter, writer, guitarist by passion. I started this page to pursue my hobby. I always liked music, it is my most favourite hobby. I was a pretty good dancer years ago but now I can not follow dancing. Writing is my pastime. Guitar is my teenage attraction. I always wanted to be a rock guitarist. <br><br><br>I used to come first in my school life, in primary and in high school also. My drawing was also good. I never met any person who has not appreciated about my talent. I know that I have got some talent and I want it to show , to express, to share it with the world.</p>
